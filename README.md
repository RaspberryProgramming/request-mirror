# Request Mirror
This application provides a web ui for sending get/post requests and provides a visual ui for looking at what the application received. This is written in rust.

## TODO:
 - Update Readme
 - Document
 - Setup Docker

## Docker

This is the current setup for getting the webapp to work with docker. This may not work on your machine, this is beta.

```bash
cd request-mirror

sh deploy.sh
```

This will setup the container. A better setup will come in the future.
